## Quick Start

### Claude Code

```bash
# 1. Add the cc-design marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ZeroZ-lab/cc-design

# 2. Install the plugin
/plugin install cc-design@cc-design

# 3. Reload plugins to activate
/reload-plugins
```

After installation, cc-design activates via `/cc-design:design` command.

### Codex

```bash
# 1. Add the cc-design marketplace from GitHub
/plugin marketplace add ZeroZ-lab/cc-design

# 2. Install the plugin
/plugin install cc-design@cc-design

# 3. Reload plugins to activate
/reload-plugins
```

After installation, cc-design activates via `$cc-design` reference.

### Example prompts

```
"Design a landing page for our SaaS product"
"Create a 10-slide pitch deck for the Q3 board meeting"
"Build an interactive prototype of the checkout flow"
"Create an interactive explainer showing how our RAG pipeline works"
"Make a comparison explainer for React vs Vue"
"Build a decision tree for tech stack selection"
"Animate this logo reveal with the Pentagram style"
"Export the deck as editable PPTX"
```

cc-design handles context gathering, design planning, quality checks, and verification — you approve the plan, it builds.

## Capabilities

| Category | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Design outputs** | Landing pages, slide decks, interactive prototypes, interactive explainers (flow, compare, decision tree), wireframes, animations, design systems, motion studies |
| **Design thinking** | 8-layer framework (Goal → Validation), 10 core principles, 20 philosophy schools |
| **Brand cloning** | Progressive loading of 68+ brand design systems from [getdesign.md](https://getdesign.md) |
| **Quality guardrails** | Anti-AI slop rules, typography system, spacing scale, mandatory screenshot verification |
| **Variations** | 3+ design directions across layout, interaction, visual intensity, and motion |
| **Export** | PDF (multi-file + single-file), PPTX (image + editable), MP4 video, inline HTML |
| **Audio** | Dual-track audio (SFX + BGM), 37 SFX catalog, ffmpeg mixing |
| **Design review** | 5-dimension scoring: philosophy, hierarchy, craft, functionality, originality |
| **Animation** | Stage+Sprite timeline engine, easing library, Seek-First numerical verification (`__seek` + `getComputedStyle`), signal protocol, pitfall guardrails |
| **Prototyping** | React + Babel inline JSX, device frames (iOS, Android, macOS, browser) |

## Design Styles

Mention a philosophy school to set the direction:

```
"Use the Pentagram style for this infographic"
"Apply Experimental Jetset minimalism to this poster"
"Mix Takram restraint with Locomotive motion for the hero"
```

20 schools across 5 traditions — Information Architects, Motion Poets, Minimalists, Experimental Vanguard, Eastern Philosophy. See `references/design-styles.md`.

### Brand Style Cloning

Mention a brand name to load its design system:

```
"Create a pricing page with Stripe's aesthetic"
"Notion-style kanban board"
"Mix Vercel's minimalism with Linear's purple accents"
```

## How It Works

```
Understand → Route → Plan → Approve → Build → Verify → Deliver
```

1. **Understand** — cc-design asks targeted questions to lock the output type, audience, and constraints
2. **Plan** — presents a visible execution plan with goals, facts, and assumptions
3. **Approve** — you approve before any code is written
4. **Build** — per-section preview pattern; you approve section by section
5. **Verify** — three-phase self-check (structural, visual, design excellence)
6. **Deliver** — screenshot-verified artifact ready to use

Key behavioral guarantees:
- Never builds without an approved plan
- Never delivers without screenshot verification
- Never uses AI slop patterns (banned gradients, emoji spam, generic layouts)
- Follow-ups and minor edits skip the full discovery flow

## Optional Dependencies

Core installation has no extra dependencies. For export features:

```bash
# Playwright browser (for export and verification)
npx playwright install chromium

# Video and audio export
brew install ffmpeg          # macOS
sudo apt install ffmpeg      # Ubuntu/Debian
choco install ffmpeg         # Windows
```

## Platform Integration

| Platform | Activation | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `/design` command | Commands + SKILL.md |
| **Codex / OpenAI** | `$cc-design` reference | `agents/openai.yaml` |

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo, create a feature branch
2. Keep `SKILL.md` under 200 lines — move technical content to `references/`
3. Add new references to `load-manifest.json` and the routing table in `SKILL.md`
4. Run `node scripts/lint-load-manifest.mjs` and `node scripts/generate-bundle-catalog.mjs`
5. If changing first-turn behavior: update `VERSION`, `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `references/workflow.md`, then run `./scripts/check-behavior-contract.sh <base-ref>`

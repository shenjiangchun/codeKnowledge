# Design Thinking Framework: 8-Layer Design System

> **Load when:** Complex multi-screen flows, design system creation, architecture decisions, need complete design thinking
> **Skip when:** Simple visual adjustments, single component modifications, clear small changes
> **Why it matters:** Provides complete design decision framework, ensures no critical layers are missed
> **Typical failure it prevents:** Focusing only on visuals while ignoring goals, surface-level work without system thinking, designs that can't be implemented

The 8-layer design framework is cc-design's core methodology. It breaks design into 8 layers, each with clear focus areas, decision methods, and validation criteria.

---

## Why We Need the 8-Layer Framework

### Common Problems

**Only focusing on visuals:**
- "Make a nice-looking dashboard" → Don't know what data to show
- "Reference Apple style" → Don't know why it should look like Apple
- "Add a gradient" → Don't know what problem the gradient solves

**Only focusing on functionality:**
- "Implement these 20 features" → Don't know the priorities
- "Everything is important" → Information overload
- "As long as it works" → Poor experience

**Lacking system thinking:**
- Redesigning from scratch every time → Can't reuse
- Inconsistent style → High cognitive load
- Can't scale → Technical debt accumulates

### Value of the 8-Layer Framework

1. **Completeness**: Covers the full flow from goals to validation
2. **Priority**: Clear layer dependency relationships
3. **Checkable**: Each layer has clear validation criteria
4. **Teachable**: Beginners can learn by following the framework
5. **Diagnostic**: Quickly locate design problems

## 8-Layer Design System

### Layer 1: Goal Design (Why)

**Definition:** Clarify the problem to solve, users to serve, and expected changes.

**Key Questions:**
- What problem does this solve?
- Who is it for? (User personas, scenarios)
- What change is expected? (Behavior, cognition, emotion)
- What are the success criteria?
- How to prioritize?

**Thought Keywords:** Problem definition, value hypothesis, success metrics, prioritization

**Why It Matters:**
- Goals determine the direction of all other layers
- No goals = no evaluation criteria
- Wrong goals → correct execution is still failure

**Existing Documents:**
- `junior-designer-mode.md` - Assumptions and questions for new tasks
- `design-context.md` - Context understanding

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Can explain the core problem in one sentence
- [ ] Can describe target users and usage scenarios
- [ ] Has clear success metrics
- [ ] Has clear priority ordering

---

### Layer 2: Information Design (What to Say, How to Say It)

**Definition:** Filter, organize, and sequence information to establish cognitive paths.

**Key Questions:**
- What information must be shown? (Filtering)
- How to group? (Categorization)
- How to sequence? (Priority)
- How to establish hierarchy? (Primary-secondary relationships)
- What is the user's cognitive path? (Reading order)

**Thought Keywords:** Filtering, grouping, sequencing, hierarchy, compression, cognitive path

**Why It Matters:**
- Information overload is the most common design problem
- Good information design = users can quickly find what they need
- Information structure determines page structure

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Miller's Law: People can only process 7±2 information chunks simultaneously
- Cognitive Load Theory: Reduce unnecessary cognitive consumption
- Chunking: Organize information into meaningful blocks

**Existing Documents:**

### Layer 3: Structure Design (Skeleton)

**Definition:** Build page structure, divide modules, establish layout system.

**Key Questions:**
- How to divide page areas?
- What are the relationships between modules?
- How to design navigation?
- What are the layout system rules?
- How to adapt to different screens?

**Thought Keywords:** Order, relationships, organization, architecture, grid

**Why It Matters:**
- Structure is the skeleton of visuals
- Good structure = clear sense of order
- Structure constrains interaction and visuals

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Grid system: Establish visual order
- Modularization: Reduce complexity
- Responsive design: Adapt to multiple devices

**Existing Documents:**
- `design-patterns.md` - Classic layout patterns

**Key Questions:**
- How do users complete tasks? (Flow)
- What feedback after operations? (Feedback)
- How to show different states? (States)
- How to handle errors? (Error handling)
- Is the operation cost reasonable? (Efficiency)

**Thought Keywords:** Natural, low friction, predictable, feedback, fault tolerance

**Why It Matters:**
- Interaction determines user experience
- Good interaction = users don't notice the interaction
- Interaction problems lead to task failure

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Fitts's Law: Larger and closer targets are easier to click
- Hick's Law: More choices slow down decisions
- Feedback psychology: Immediate feedback reduces anxiety
- Affordance: Design hints at how to use

**Existing Documents:**

- Good design = validated design
- Iteration is the only way to progress

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Lean design: Build → Measure → Learn

## Relationships Between Layers

### Dependency Relationships (Top-Down)

```
Layer 1: Goal
   ↓ determines
Layer 2: Information
   ↓ influences
Layer 3: Structure
   ↓ constrains
Layer 4: Interaction
   ↓ requires
Layer 5: Visual
   ↓ embodies
Layer 6: Brand
   ↓ standardizes
Layer 7: System
   ↓ validates
Layer 8: Validation
   ↓ feeds back to
Layer 1: Goal (iteration)
```

**Key Dependencies:**
- Goal layer determines the direction of all other layers
- Information layer influences structure layer (content determines form)
- Structure layer constrains interaction layer (layout determines operations)
- Visual and brand layers must serve the first 4 layers
- System layer standardizes the first 6 layers
- Validation layer feeds back to goal layer forming a closed loop

---

### Conflict Resolution Rules

When layers conflict, priority order:

**Goal > Information > Structure > Interaction > Visual > Brand**

**Examples:**

**Conflict 1: Visual vs Information**
- Problem: Large title looks beautiful, but information hierarchy is unclear
- Decision: Reduce title size, ensure hierarchy clarity
- Reason: Information > Visual

**Conflict 2: Brand vs Interaction**
- Problem: Brand requires special font, but readability is poor
- Decision: Use brand font for titles, readable font for body text
- Reason: Interaction > Brand

**Conflict 3: System Consistency vs Local Optimization**
- Problem: 12px works better for this page, but system uses 14px
- Decision: Keep 14px, maintain system consistency
- Reason: System > Local

**Exception: Can break rules when goal layer explicitly requires**
- If goal is "brand showcase", Brand > Interaction
- If goal is "visual impact", Visual > Information
- But must have clear reasoning and tradeoffs

## Relationship to Execution Workflow

**8-Layer Framework = Thinking Model** (what to think about)
**workflow.md = Execution Process** (how to execute)

Use them together:
- Follow workflow.md steps during execution
- Use 8-layer framework to check for missing considerations during decision-making
- Use 8-layer framework to locate problem layers during diagnosis
- Use layer priority to resolve conflicts

See the mapping table at the beginning of `workflow.md`.

---

## Remember

1. **8-Layer Framework**: Goal → Information → Structure → Interaction → Visual → Brand → System → Validation
2. **Dependency Relationships**: Upper layers determine lower layers, lower layers serve upper layers
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Goal > Information > Structure > Interaction > Visual > Brand
4. **Complete Process**: Design top-down, validate bottom-up
5. **Diagnostic Method**: Symptom → Locate layer → Check dependencies → Fix root cause

**The 8-layer framework is not a process, it's a thinking model.**
